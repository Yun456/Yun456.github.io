              Doctoral researcher on novel family-focused interfaces for internet-connected services. <i>I started at Northumbria (2017) and transferred with the job to Newcastle (2019)</i>


              - Designed and developed a physical data visualisations IoT toolkit ([Domestic Widgets](https://www.davidverweij.com/domesticwidgets/){:target="_blank"}).

              - Iterative developed a natural language processing interface, embedded hardware and bespoke web services for data management and access.              

              - Created a Google Sheets extension ([Phone Grown](https://www.davidverweij.com/phonegrown/){:target="_blank"}) for ambient information displays in conjunction with IFTTT.com.

              - Designed an accompanying Google Sheet template and written [tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/Turn-an-Unused-Smartphone-Into-a-Smart-Display/){:target="_blank"} supporting a do-it-yourself, scalable and open-source dissemination of this tool.

              - Through the in-situ deployment of these tools, observation and interviews I qualitatively study how domestic connected devices can be better designed with families in mind, and for which potential shared purposes.
