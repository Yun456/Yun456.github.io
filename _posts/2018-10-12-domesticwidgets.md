<p>As part of my PhD, I am looking into research methods to involve and empower families in the development of future Internet of Things (IoT) products and scenarios. Over the last decade(s), a growth of tools, platforms and consumer products has lowered the threshold to get involved in Do-It-Yourself (DIY) practises. Whilst self-built (or at least assembled) connected products are becoming more common, not all members of a household are necessarily involved â€“ or interested for that matter. By leveraging the household creativity of existing activities, such as tinkering and crafting with household materials, I aim to involve more members of the household in these activities.
<br/><br/>
Domestic Widgets is a kit that allows households to create 'physical data visualisations' using everyday materials and tools. With a minimal amount of components and a voice assistant for control, families can jointly craft IoT objects without coding or soldering.
