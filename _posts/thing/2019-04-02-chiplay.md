<p>As Design Chair (and initially Web Chair) for the 2019 CHI PLAY conference I was tasked with the development of the logo and visual style, and apply this throughout the website and other physical media. Given the continuation of the form, I've incorporated the glass-in-lead windows of the La Sagrada Familia to reflect the location of 2019: Barcelona. Similarly, the bright range of colours return throughout the website and are represented in a poster that incorporates photos from last year's edition.</p>
