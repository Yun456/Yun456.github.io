<p>Implicitely human-poweredness is the concept that energy harvesting mechanisms are used and embedded in a devices interaction modality such that they work almost invisibly. Rather than asking people to repeat a certain movement (e.g. a dyno-torch or rechargeable crank-battery), this concept argues to limit a device's functionality and more tightly integrate the energy harvesting. For example, rather than a complex e-reader with Wi-Fi capabilities, I conceptualise a battery-less e-ink display, capable of storing a single e-book. Using the integrated handle, a single (180 degrees, not multiple) page-flip movement will generate the energy required to navigate to the next or previous page. Six concepts were ideated with this concept and submitted to an academix workshop on self-sustainability.
