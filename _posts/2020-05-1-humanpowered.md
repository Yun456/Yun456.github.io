<p>Implicitely human-poweredness is a proposal for battery-less interaction design. Rather than asking people to repeat a certain movement (e.g. a dyno-torch or rechargeable crank-battery) to generate energy for complex devices, I want energy harvesting mechanisms to be used and embedded such that you won't even notice it. I deem this possible to such an extent that when we strip devices and services to their core value proposition, these devices can operate without any battery - and only when in use. For example, rather than a complex e-reader with Wi-Fi capabilities, I conceptualise a battery-less e-ink display, capable of storing a single e-book. Using the integrated handle, a single (180 degrees, not multiple) page-flip movement will generate the energy required to navigate to the next or previous page. Six concepts were ideated, based on existing (functional) mechanisms, to illustrate this concept.

<h2 class="h2">Technology</h2>
<p>
Whilst conceptual, each design is based on existing energy-generating mechanism and their expected energy performance. Some are present in existing products, such as battery-less <u><a href="https://www.magniclight.com/en/" target="_blank">bike lights</a></u>, <u><a href="https://www2.meethue.com/en-gb/p/hue-tap-switch/8718696743133" target="_blank">light switches</a></u> or <u><a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.352.7129&rep=rep1&type=pdf" target="_blank">TV remotes</a></u>.
</p>
<h2 class="h2">Contribution</h2>
<p>
I am increasingly more interested in the societal impact of our products and tools, and how might improve our unsustainable drive for more data and connectivity. I developed this concept and the six designs, which originally arose from experiments with low-energy hardware. I have a few more designs in mind, and - when I find the time - will start prototyping understand its viability.
