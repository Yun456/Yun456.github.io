WaveTrace is a novel interaction technique based on selection by motion matching. In motion matching systems, targets move continuously in a singular and pre-defined path -- users interact with these by performing a synchronous bodily movement that matches the movement of one of the targets. Unlike previous work which tracks user input through optical systems, WaveTrace is arguably the first motion matching technique to rely on motion data from inertial measurement units readily available in many wrist-worn wearable devices such as smart watches.
