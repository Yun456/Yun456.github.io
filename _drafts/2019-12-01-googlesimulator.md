<p>To demonstrate the Domestic Widgets concept in a open an public space (e.g. a conference or event), I developed a web-app that mimics the Domestic Widget Agent on the Google Assistant. The goal was to replicate the experience of the functional Conversation Agent, but prevent erronous user interaction and distracting functionalities. This web-app allowed users to access most functionality as in the original App, however with – instead of voice control – touch based input. By setting up a tablet in kiosk mode, this web-app could effectively be used by any visitor and be left turned-on throughout the event. The user’s actions would still functionally affect the Domestic Widgets (which is this app’s purpose). You can try this experience here. For demonstration purposes, this version is disconnected from the database.</p>
