<p>My colleague and friend, Selina Sutton, a PhD researcher on human-computer interaction and sociolinguistics, asked me to design a logo for the Newcastle Postgraduate Conference in Linguistics she was co-organising. The logo aims to represent the conference focus on Newcastle with its plentiful bridges. I noticed the logo has been adapted to personal needs ever since.</p>
