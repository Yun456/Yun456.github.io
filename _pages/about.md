I am a creative technologist building digital and physical products, and currently finishing my Doctoral Thesis in Computer Science. Originally taught as an interactive product and experience designer, I currently have 5+ years part-time experience in software development for bespoke products and services. I involve potential users in the exploration of novel approaches to digital services. I am a social person with a creative and analytical mindset, learning from and adapting existing problems and solutions to create services along the developer stack. I am self-directed and resourceful, and eager to work in a team on high quality deliverables for meeting stakeholder expectations.
<br/><br/>
In my free time, I experiment with designing software, hardware and product design, and enjoy woodworking, being outdoors and boardgames.
